#MAIN AIM; The aim of this code is to get a text whenever there's an available flight with a price lower than what we have in the sheets. In my case, my departure is LONDON. So i'm looking to get a flight that goes from LONDON to any of those cities in the sheets, but at a ticket price lower than the prices set in the sheet. We should get a text message when the flight tickets are lower than the ticket prices on the sheet.
