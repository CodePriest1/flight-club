Use the Flight Search API to check for the cheapest flights from tomorrow to 6 months later for all the cities in the Google Sheet.

If the price is lower than the lowest price listed in the Google Sheet then send an SMS to your own number with the Twilio API.

The SMS should include the departure airport IATA code, destination airport IATA code, departure city, destination city, flight price and flight dates.e.g
